# The User Guide

### Important notes: Do not use commands on the chat but instead press '~' button on the keyboard to open the console window.

## How to start:

### Registration, Login, Passwords, Nicknames:
- To get access to most features on the server with Lugormod-X installed, player must register an account first.
Use '~' button to open the console window and then type the command **register |username| |password|** to create a new account.

If the authentication process is successful keep your username and password from now because you will need them to log in to the account.
If the server uses a security code system by default, your 4-digit security code will be generated. Keep it save too because you can recover it only through contact with server's administration.
- The command **seccode** allows to check your security code, |new| generate a new one, |toggle| enable or disable it. If is enabled, the code is necessary when you are going to log in using a new IP address.

- To log in to the account use the command **login |username| |password|** or **login |username| |password| |seccode|**, if the security code is enabled and you are trying to log in from a new IP address.

- To change the account's password use **chpasswd |new_password|** command.

You can not change your username but instead it is possible to change your in-game name called nickname, netname, alias.
- To change the nickname use **alias |new_name|** command.

## Most important commands you need to know:
- **help** and **help |command|** to show more detailed information about commands available.
- **register |username| |password|** to register a new account.
- **login |username| |password|**, **login |username| |password| |seccode|** to log in to an existing account.
- **chpasswd |new_password|** to change the account's password.
- **alias |new_name|** to change in-game name. The user name will not change so your login data remains the same.
