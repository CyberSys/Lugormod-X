### Small Note: There is not need to use full commands, it is possible to short most of them, E.g. profession -> prof, register -> reg, skill jedi heal -> sk j h etc.

## How to start:

### Registration, Login, Passwords, Nicknames:
- To get access to most features on the server with Lugormod-X installed, player must log in to his account first.

To create a new account, use '~' button to open the console window and then type the command **register |username| |password|**.

If the authentication process is successful keep your username and password from now because you will need them to log in to the account.
If the server uses a security code system by default, your 4-digit security code will be generated. Keep it save too because you can recover it only through contact with server's administration.
- The command **seccode** allows to check your security code, **seccode new** will generate a new one, **seccode toggle** will enable or disable it. If it is enabled, the code is necessary when you are going to log in using a new IP address.

- To log in to the account use the command **login |username| |password|** or **login |username| |password| |seccode|**, if the security code is enabled and you are trying to log in from a new IP address.

- To change the account's password use **chpasswd |new_password|** command.

You can not change your username but instead it is possible to change your in-game name called nickname, netname, alias.
- To change the nickname use **alias |new_name|** command.

### Professions, Skills, Statistics:
- Before evolving character, upgrading skills and gaining levels, the player must choose his profession. 

To check the professions list type **profession**. 
To choose a new profession use **profession |name|**. You can change your profession whenever you'd like to.
